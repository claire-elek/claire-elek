- 👋 Hi, I’m @claire-elek, a Phage Biologist working with Phage Australia at WIMR in Prof Jon Iredell's group.
- 👀 I’m interested in utilisation of phages as alternatives or adjunctives to antibiotics, but I've also developed a love for genomics, particularly phage genomics.
- 🌱 I’m still learning how to navigate the world of bioinformatics, coming predominantly from a wet lab background, but having been exposed to a lot of genomics during my PhD.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on all things genomics - there's so much I want to learn!
- 📫 You can find me on LinkedIn (Dr Claire Elek, PhD) :)
